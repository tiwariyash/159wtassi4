# DB-connnection-using-API-PHP
1). Created an API to perform the following operations on the database table (consider the registration form of practical no. 
2). Created a separate class for handling the queries related to the database. When the user fills the form and hits the submit button call the js function to send the form data to API so that it will store it in the database table and respond back success or failure to the client to display the message to the user. Next, whenever users click on show registrations then call another js function which makes the call to API that will fetch all the records from the database and send the response back to the client as a JSON string, convert the string into a JSON object and then display the record in a table. Deploy the application on any free web hosting provider and upload the code on GitHub and submit both the URL's in a PDF file.
